# How to emerge a version before v1.3.210

An example:

```
sudo emerge --ask =dev-util/vulkan-headers-1.3.209
```

For specifically this repo for whatever reason:

```
sudo emerge --ask =dev-util/vulkan-headers-1.3.209::vulkano-edge
```

# Notes

- Doing ```emerge --sync``` should update the repo when updating gentoo
- For using an older package, Gentoo likes to update the package to the latest unless specified in ```/etc/portage/..``` for more information visit [the gentoo wiki](https://wiki.gentoo.org) to try and mitigate Gentoo from updating the package to ```v1.3.210``` or later
